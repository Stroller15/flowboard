  <h3 align="center">Flowboard</h3>

  <p>Flowboard is like a smart to-do list where you can create columns and add task cards. You can easily slide these task cards from one column to another, which helps in organizing and sorting tasks as you work on them. This sliding feature makes it simple to move tasks from 'to-do' to 'done,' giving you a clear view of your progress. It's a user-friendly tool that helps individuals or teams manage tasks smoothly and visually track their workflow stages.</p>
